This section written by wb8tyw.

Development on Windows is new to wb8tyw as is these new GUI tool kits.

The idea for this file is to collect information as it happens so that it
does not get lost later.   And in a home environment, we don't usually have
freshly installed test test systems to verify installation issues.

Ideally we want an single package with an ".msi" file for a Microsoft
Windows environment.   We know from the lzhuf project how to create
Microsoft packages and also debian packages, and we can create them with
GitHub Actions.

Cygwin and MobaXterm allow access to your Microsoft Windows storage by using
the path /cygwin.

This allows you to both use bash shell to for git operations and you can
also test the many of the linux code paths.

Msys2 and using a WSL have a similar way to get to the Microsoft Windows
volumes.   Todo is to document these alternate methods.

In the case for wb8tyw, it is /cygwin/w/work/d-rats/drats2 .
This is a linux system that shares the work directory to all the test
and development systems over both CIFS/SMB and NFS, so wb8tyw use that linux
system for git and docker operations.

A developer will start with creating a clone of the ham-radio-software drats2
repository in their local repository.

You will need to get your ~/.gitconfig file setup at a minimum of your name,
email, and your preferred editor.   Some versions of git will issue noisy
messages if you do not specify the [push] section.

cat ~/.gitconfig
[user]
        email = wb8tyw@example.net
        name = John E. Malmberg
[core]
        editor = vim
[push]
        default=simple


The forked repository configuration needs an upstream entry

cat .git/config
[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
[remote "origin"]
        url = git@github.com:wb8tyw/drats2.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[remote "upstream"]
        url = git@github.com:ham-radio-software/drats2.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/upstream/*
[branch "main"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/main

Now getting up to date with current branch.


You want to start and keep your fork up to date with the upstream.

Updating your main branch.

git checkout main

git fetch upstream
From github.com:ham-radio-software/drats2
 * [new branch]      main       -> upstream/main

git reset --hard upstream/main
HEAD is now at a69c2e6 Setup initial project structure (#1)

Now if you have a development branch in progress that has not yet been
submitted as a Pull Request (PR), you can bring it up to date with a rebase

git branch
* main
  wb8tyw_initial_template

git checkout wb8tyw_initial_template
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/wb8tyw_initial_template'.

git rebase -i main
This will normally bring up an edit window window that will allow you to
select which commits from the updated main you want to pull into your branch.
It may point out conflicts that are blocking the merge, and then you will
need to edit the files.  The files in conflict will have both the original
and the new main versions in them.   Resolve the conflicts, and do a normal
commit.   Then follow the rebase prompts to continue the rebase.

Then if you need to update your existing online git repository branch:

git push -f

Instead of:

git push -u origin <branch_name>

As is normally done.

If you have a pull request in progress, then then what you need to is a
merge of the main branch into the test branch.

git merge --ff-only main

There is a lot of information on Internet about git, but in the worst case
you can just cancel the PR and start a new PR keeping track of what changes
you had in progress.

Once the PR is merged, normally the branch in your online git repository
is deleted.

You need to delete your local branch.

git checkout main
git branch -d <your_local_branch>


Now we want to have an install script for installing Python and the
dependencies for each type of install.

install_windows.ps1 is for installing what is needed to run d-rats on windows.
This script should not be run from an command window with Administrative
privileges.  It may pop up UAC windows for some operations.

Trying to run the script from a power shell window fails as running scripts
is disabled by policy.

It was supposed to install the latest version of Python from the Microsoft
store which was Python 3.13 instead of the Python 3.11 it did install.

We could specify the python version in the script, but that becomes a
maintenance problem when it gets missed when that version is obsolete.
python 3.11 should be good enough for our testing though.



install_mobaxterm.sh is for installing what is needed to run d-rats on
MobaXterm.

install_linux.sh is for installing what is needed to run d-rats on various
linux platforms.

We will have different requirements.txt files for pip based on which
platform, etcetera.  Various security tools look for requirements.txt to
flag if an known unsafe package is listed, so we will put each
requirements.txt in their own directory instead making requirements_xxx.txt
files.

Visual Studio Code notes:
On detecting a ps1 file, VSC will prompt to install the "Powershell" from
Microsoft extension.   When installed, the plugin will ask you to upgrade to
most current Powershell.   Wb8tyw declined the upgrade to be more compatible
with end users.

Testing the scripts:

Test system1:  Windows-11
  Currently using as a development system.
  Testing for using Windows Python.
  Testing using MobaXterm Free edition.

Test system2:  Windows-10
  Testing Msys2 using VNC from test system1

Test system3:  Raspbian (Debian Bookworm)
  Testing via X11/SSH tunneling from test system1

Test system4:  Fedora/41
  Testing via X11/SSH tunneling from test system1

Test system5:  Ubuntu 22.04
  Testing via X11/SSH tunneling from test system1

No audio available when testing remote.

The working directory was set to the git checkout directory.

Native Windows used Visual Studio code to run ./install_windows.ps1.
At this time, only the packages needed for testing the various gui packages
are being installed.   This seems to work as reported by pip freeze.

Mobaxterm test:
First problem: the cygwin environment is checking the UID/GID of the served
file system and determined that it does not have permission.

Issued in Mobaxterm
mkpasswd --local > /etc/passwd
mkgroup --local > /etc/group

For wb8tyw the remote uid/gid: 4294967295 4294967295

For the /etc/group wb8tyw added a record to copy the group "USER"

Users:S-1-5-32-545:545:
Users2:S-1-5-32-545:4294967295:

A similar edit was made to the /edt/passwd file, the first field is the
posix username, and the 3rd and 4th are uid and gid values.   Everything
else needs to be the same.

malmberg:*:197611:197121:U-direwolf\malmberg,...

malmberg2:*:4294967295:4294967295:U-direwolf\malmberg,...

But that only fixed the names in the ls -l display, it did not fix the
permissions issue.  So this appears to only be needed for cosmetic reasons,
so probably was not needed at all.

The permissions on new files in Visual Studio code defaults to 0744 and
since Cygwin/MobaXterm still sees this as a different user and group, it
does not work.   Changing the permissions in the MobaXterm session do not
work as it does not have permissions.

The changes need to be made on the SMB/CIFS/NFS server host.
chmod 0755 *.sh

That got the linux_install.sh script working and makes sure that when
these files get committed to git they will have the correct permissions.

The kivy package did not install on cygwin/MobaXterm no matter what I
tried.

For some tests, On some systems you have to use python3 <program_name> to
run the test program.
These are all minimal programs, most just putting up a window that exits
when it is closed.

Python packaging:
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/
https://docs.python-guide.org/

It looks like we need a src subdirectory for each project for them to be
packaged.

Each module that could be reused by other projects should be in its own
package.

We do not want to be duplicating code either.

Now every program needs a help/about window with the program version and
other information.

We do not want to be editing a version file, we want to use git-tags
where they are available.  The fun comes from when we just download a
tarball from git, and that tarball does not contain the git metadata.

So what we will do is setup a version_git package based on the version.py
module from from the D-Rats repository.   All this module will do is
parse handle parsing the git version.   This will be created as a generic
package so it may be used by other projects.

A tag of '0.0.0dev0' was created for testing the module.

The plan is for the version_git.py program to be run for each commit and
update a file which will be included with the commit.  This will allow
git tarball installs to work.

This new directory layout will require using PYTHONPATH for testing.

On Microsoft Windows Powershell variables of interest are below.  most
can be accessed from a command window by putting them using %name%.
In general for use, the variables are case insensitive, but a python lookup
to read their values may need to be in exact case.

* $Env:PYTHONPATH - Where python searches for modules, usually colon
                    delimiter.
* $Env:APPDATA - This is where a program should store data that may
                 be replicated to other computers.
* $Env:COMPUTERNAME - your computer's name.
* $Env:HOMEPATH - Your home path
* $env:LANG - default locale language like en_US.UTF-8
* $env:LOCALAPPDATA - This is where a program should store data that is
                      local to this system
* $env:OneDrive - Microsoft OneDrive mirrored directory, even if this
                  environment variable exists, it does not mean the
                  directory is setup to be usable.
* $Env:OS - Reports "Windows_NT" on Windows 11
* $Env:Path - Paths to search for executables delimited by semicolons
* $Env:PATHEXT - Semicolon separated list of "executable" extensions
* $Env:TMP - local user temporary files.
* $Env:TEMP - Usually the same as $ENV.TMP
* $Env:USERNAME - Your login name
* $Env:PUBLIC - A public directory, typically $Env:SystemDrive\Users\public

A bash script may need to be able to detect what platform it is to handle
the differences between such platforms.

For a Linux environment, the first thing to do is see if the file
"/etc/os-release" exists, and if it does exist, source it.

The MobaXterm environment does not have an /etc/os-release file.

This bash code shows how to collect the data.

: "${NAME:=}"
: "${ID:=}"
: "${ID_LIKE:=}"               # Seen on Ubuntu, not on fedora.
: "${VERSION_ID:=}"           # Not on Msys2
: "${COMPUTERNAME:=}"         # Only present on Linux emulation on Windows.
: "${MSYSTEM:=}"              # Only present on Msys2
: "${MOBASTARTUPDIR:=}"  # Only seen on MobaXterm
if [ -e /etc/os-release ]; then
    # shellcheck disable=SC1091
    source /etc/os-release
fi

MobaXterm and cygwin both have "/cygdrive" directories.

We can not detect linux running under Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and
it is possible for multiple linux environments to be running.

Powershell getting current directory for a script.

$my_dir = Get-Location()
$my_dir.ToString()

To fully test the new D-Rats we will need a more complex PYTHONPATH,
which we will have to hide from the end user in some way for the final
program.

Powershell test of version_git module.

$Env:PYTHONPATH=".\version_git\src\"
python -m version

Next is to try making a package out of it.
Previously I used setuptools for D-Rats and had some issue.
The python example for packaging defaults to using hatchling, which is
said to be simpler.

It looks like we are going to have multiple pyproject.toml files with
almost identical content.

We are going to need a script to make sure that they are properly maintained.

There are various ways to install hatchling, but it looks like the most
universal is to use PIP with PyPi.   This is the same as with PIP.

So this will need a virtual environment.   I have a common directory to
multiple environments, so I will need to create a virtual environment for
each system and environment.  A single Microsoft Windows host may have
multiple virtual environments.

As I recall, in some cases I can not run programs from a network hosted
virtual env on some windows environments.  I think the problem showed up
msys2 on windows 7.  For that I had to create the virtual environment in
the home directory.

For windows-11 native:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv/html

Network storage seems to work for a virtual environment on native Microsoft
windows.

python -m venv .\"$Env:COMPUTERNAME"_WIN_build_env --upgrade-deps
This seems to be take quite a while to run.

This was the only way I could find to activate it was to issue a 'cmd'
command first

cmd

This seems to have launched or changed a command window in Visual Studio Code
In that I could run:

.\"$Env:COMPUTERNAME"_build_env\scripts\activate.bat

The other way required installing the full python from the python.org site
instead of installing the Windows Store python which is more limited.

This would mean that I would be testing in a different environment than
the end users would likely be using.

In the cmd window:

pip install -U -r build\requirements.txt ^
    --no-warn-script-location

This also installed a bunch of stuff.
And took a few minutes.

Following https://hatch/pypa.io/latest/intro/ for these steps

Apparently this is an interactive quiz to setup the directory for
hatch to package.

cd version_git
hatch new --init

This asked some questions about what I had in the pyproject.toml file and
then it wrote that it updated that file.   Editor showed no changes.

Next is understanding dynamic versioning.

The dynamic versioning is from reading a file containing the line:
   __version__ = "x.y.z"

So it is like original d-rats project, we have to run a script to prepare
the repository for a package build before doing a build.   This is needed
to create the message catalogs, run towncrier to create the News.RST file.

We have to run a script to create that file.
Just like we will have to run a script to build the message catalogs

Hatch turns out to not being a savings.   Need to go back to setuptools which
we understand better.

For setuptools, the first thing we need is to have towncrier build the
changelog.

Towncrier needs a newsfragments subdirectory for input and also will modify
a NEWS.rst file.  The documentation is a bit unclear from first showing a
non-default changes directory and then switching to using the term
newsfragments.

New self documentation standard quick reference:

https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html

Getting packages to build was a bit of a struggle.

Finally found out how to get the license name in the pyproject.toml file as
all the online documentation was out of date.

Then the next battle was getting a test program to be able to call the
version_git program and get the data for the version and the about box.

And then getting the package built with the correct version with
towncrier.

And Kivy required a change on how logging was setup.  Kivy creates its
own Logger object that needs to be used.  So that means that we have to
pass that logger to all classes that need to do their logging, and setup
a wrapper methods to the logger in the class to make sure that the messages
end up formatted correctly.

So at this point we can build python packages.

This is still the boring boiler plate stuff before we can actually start
working on real code.

The next steps needed for packaging are, not necessarily in order are:

* Create about dialog boxes to for the GUI packages.

* Create platform specific packages.

* Github actions for creating python and platform specific packages.

* Start creating Android APK files.

* Investigate using Pydoc for generating documentation.

* Make sure that getenv and Internationalization works.

All of that is still boilerplate stuff.

The Pydoc seems the most important to get working next before implementing
as so that we are not back tracking.

The internationalization is also important to get working early, and then
the about dialogs.
